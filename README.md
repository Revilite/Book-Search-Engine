## Description
In this assignment, I was tasked to translate this react application from a RESTful api into a MERN api. With the google books api i needed to search a book and save that into my database that runs on mongodb, you are also able to view your saved books on the saved books tab. While you are on the save books tab you are able to delete the saved book of your choice.
